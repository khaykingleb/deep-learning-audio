  # Sometimes itâ€™s helpful to only use a fraction of your training, val, test, or predict data (or a set number of batches).
  # For example, you can use 20% of the training set and 1% of the validation set.
  # On larger datasets like Imagenet, this can help you debug or test a few things faster than waiting for a full epoch.
  # * Use only 10% of training data and 1% of val data:
  #   trainer = Trainer(limit_train_batches=0.1, limit_val_batches=0.01)
  # * Use 10 batches of train and 5 batches of val:
  #   trainer = Trainer(limit_train_batches=10, limit_val_batches=5)
